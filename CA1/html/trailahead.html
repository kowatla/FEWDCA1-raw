          Apple & Google are arguably the most successful tech companies and are
          really desirable environments to work in. Both companies have
          incredible resources and employees that work in them. They have a huge
          emphasis on human resource and development and offer many attractive
          perks to work with. All in all working in these giants would be a
          privilege that I would not resist.

        <div>
          The main difference between these giants are the organization
          structures. Apple has operates in a centralized and unified structure
          while google operates with a decentralized and diversified structure.
          Both systems have their advantages and I hope to experience working in
          both companies in the future.
