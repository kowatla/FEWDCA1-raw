          I came across one of Apple's Worldwide Developer Conferences about the
          newest and greatest technologies that apple has been developing over
          the over the past year and immediately became fascinated by how
          technology can impact and change peoples lives for the better.

          In Secondary School, we had ict lessons and were taught how to make
          programs and mini games using Scratch. This has introduced me to the
          world of programming and has taught me programming and unique
          Javascript concepts such as loops, functions and event listeners.

          When I got my first iPad, I was eager to try out Swift Playgrounds to
          try out and learn more about programming. This formally introduced me
          to the world of programming and Swift, which further developed my
          Interests in Computer Science and Software Development.

          After getting my mac, I started learning Python on Pycharm myself
          online from this content creator named Mike Dane. I started learning
          Python because it is one of the most beginner friendly and versatile
          programming languages. By learning Python, it has dramatically
          enforced my understanding of how to program and develop. Mike Dane on
          YouTube has done an amazing job at breaking down concepts for
          beginners to learn and understand from

          I decided to learn a bunch of other programming languages to explore
          around the development space. In fact, I have learned all the
          programming languages that you saw at the start of the each page! I
          have also tried many different development environments like eclipse,
          xcode, visual studio and of course, vscode. This has helped me to
          explore around and help build the best configuration for my use needs.
